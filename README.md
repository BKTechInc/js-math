Would you like to view and understand the code for **JS Math**? Go to [`RAWFILES.md`](https://github.com/BKTechInc/js-math/blob/master/RAWFILES.md) to view all the unminified code for more clarity and understanding to this project. `index.html`, `style.css`, & `script.js` are all minifed code, which is **usually** harder to read and understand.
